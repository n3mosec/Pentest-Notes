# Enable Remote Desktop

* Because sometimes you just got to have that GUI!

```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

* Usually it works without reboot, but this may be required in some cases



Allow RDP through firewall

```
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote desktop" new enable=Yes
```
