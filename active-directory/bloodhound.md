```
bloodhound-python -d domain.com -u username -p passwsord -dc domain.com -ns $dcIP -c all

* You can limit collection with comma-separated queries. see official doc above but I usually grab everything

**NB: Collection method -All does **_**not**_** include GPOLocalGroup, so I normally add that!**

[https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\_images/SharpHoundCheatSheet.png](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\_images/SharpHoundCheatSheet.png)

```
SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethod All,GPOLocalGroup --Domain $domain
```

### SharpHound.ps1 - Used From Victim Windows Host

```
. .\SharpHound.ps1
```

```
Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All,GPOLocalGroup -Domain domain.local
```

* adPEAS.ps1 will also dump this automatically!

### Analyzing Data In BloodHound GUI

```
neo4j start
```

```
bloodhound --no-sandbox
```

* Check out “Outbound Control Rights” to see what the a user has access to in the domain
* Sometimes the “shortest path to X” selection might work but usually it's many steps away or some ways aren't clear
