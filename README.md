# About

**NB: This is the only valid page that you should link as the rest will likely be constantly in motion.**

This book serves as a collection of notes, tools, and various resources that I've used in CTFs, exams, and the real world. Hopefully it can help you along as so many others have and continue to help me as I develop.
